      "This is our traveling museum exhibit we display at our self hosted shows. It features an array of artifacts, ephemera, and curio we’ve collected over the years that pertain to the story of Luana Moth as well as everything in her proxy.",
      "With Giovanna as head coordinator of the exhibit she has worked hard to archive and curate the specimens. She has carefully presented them in such a way to reflect the music and Luana’s journey. The museum will frequently evolve and expand as do our findings.",
      "In the densely populated display you can find photos, artwork, and interactive media to immerse yourself in Luana’s world and further your understanding of her story."
