We play with new friends “Cantor Dust”. We met at the Lynch tribute and immediately hit it off and this show was a result of that. Immensely talented people. Tremendous musicianship. And all of them so very kind with great sense of humour. Another local band that I’ve been a fan of for years but was too intimidated to introduce myself. Our set goes amazing. Crowd was amazing. Cantor Dust and Meanspath were incredible. It’s my third or fourth time watching Meanspath and it’s still just as spellbinding and mystifying.",

    "body": "For about four to five years I had been listening to this band from Niger, at times almost obsessively, and now I have somehow found myself playing a show with them. I get to the venue super early and set up as much as I can. A sprinter van pulls up behind the venue and it’s them. Our first exchanges are brief and slightly awkward due to the language barrier. They get their gear set up but the tech had to do some re-configuring so nobody could properly soundcheck yet. So the band just jams for about 45 minutes straight to just myself and one other person from their team. I am feeling extremely euphorically contemplative in this moment. If this is all that ever comes of all this I will be very very happy. There were times I never thought I would ever take my music out of the basement, and now the journey we’ve had together has somehow led to me watching one of my favourite bands, a band all the way from the Sahara, by myself in an empty venue. Five years ago I stumbled on a random youtube video with very little views of this band jamming in the desert, and now our worlds have somehow convened. I sit at the side of the stage of the empty venue trying to look chill like everything is normal whilst freaking out. I clap and cheer a bit now and then and the band giggles and bows. The tour manager, and sound person are in a corner desperately trying to figure something out and are getting frustrated. The band is so fucking unbothered it’s hilarious. They’re just having fun jamming, and I’m just there in such a state of euphoria that it’s almost reached existential crisis. Finally things get sorted and we all soundcheck. The venue quickly fills, and fills, and fills. By showtime it is overflowing and beyond sold out. We play another extremely solid set. Etran De L'Aïr plays an absolutely transcendent set. There’s people crammed into every corner of the venue and finding random things to stand on to get a better view. It’s the most people I’ve ever seen at the daughter and it’s not even close. It’s sweltering in the venue and it’s a really beautiful moment to be a part of. After the show people are slowly clearing out. I’m at the back of the venue making sure I have everything and I notice the door to the back lane is cracked open slightly. I go to see what’s back there. The band is hanging out back smoking. Before I can even say anything they smile and make an offering gesture with a pack of cigarettes. I hadn’t even stepped out the door yet. It’s like they were waiting for me. Plotting to slip right passed my best defences. I had been happily quit for two solid months. But what was I supposed to do? Stop and think responsibly for a minute before declining? I’m sad I relapsed but I’m at least glad this was how it happened. We stood around smoking in very comfortable silence for about an hour and half. We couldn’t say a whole lot to each other. About 15 minutes of silence would go by between very simple expressions of appreciation to one another. I told them I’ve been a fan since the first album and they all were very appreciative. long extended pause goes by. They said we played really great, and I expressed my gratitude the best I could. Another very long pause. Very occasionally someone would pop out from around corner to come ask them for a picture or autograph. But we mostly just stood around smoking, enjoying the warm summer evening, in silence, in the back lane of the daughter.",

But none of that matters cause we’re playing with MOYAMOYA and Public Domain has amazing espresso. There is such a palpable energy in the air. The stage is boiling hot. I love it. I feel absolutely euphoric. Since I quit smoking I’m feeling everything quite intensely. A bit hyper-emotional but it’s very good for the music. I can feel the vibrations in my soul again. I’m not numb anymore. I get into flow state effortlessly now and it’s easier to channel Luana’s energies. Sometimes it doesn’t even feel like it’s me playing. This night had such a beautifully intense feel. Spirits are sky high for everyone. But once the night starts winding down I am realizing I’m having difficulties metabolizing the excitement. I get hit with a bit of dizziness just before packing up and I feel kind of faint. I instinctively start downing the water jug at the bar, trying to play it cool and not draw attention to myself. It slowly builds into the middle of the night and peaks with a full fledged panic attack at around 4 am. The room is spinning wildly and no matter how deeply I breathe I feel like I’m not getting any air. I eventually settle down though and finally get to sleep. Thankfully this marked the end of a particularly bad season of insomnia. I wake up at about 1pm feeling amazing.",

I don’t know if it was the sleep deprivation but I was suddenly compelled to play guitar with my teeth during a solo. I was in such a flow state and it just kinda happened.

To pay tribute to one of our favourite artists of all time. Someone who’s work has been instrumental and formative to us on a fundamental level. This was something we would not approach casually. Immediately upon accepting this challenge we set our M.O. which was to ATTEMPT something that could possibly be appreciated by Lynch himself, while staying true to the voice of our own project. To stay true to the artistic philosophies that Lynch operated on, while imagining his oeuvre through the lens of LUANA MOTH. All the while referencing specific moments that left the deepest impressions on us personally, without alienating the other Lynch fans that would be in attendance. However hubristic or perhaps foolishly bold our approach was, we felt the risk alone in shooting for these goals was the best way we could have paid tribute to Lynch. The two shows went exceptionally well. The first show I was a bit sloppy for me as there was no real soundcheck and I quickly learned our usual formula for operating LUANA MOTH, would not work for our Lynch set. But we figured it out as we went and the second day was easily the best I have ever played the Lynch set. I’ve never played it that immaculately, not even at home during practice. Giova made a 1:1 replica of Spike the Eraserhead baby and everyone gets quite a kick out of it. Spike is passed around throughout the shows for photo opps.",

Our hero David Lynch had just passed away and we dedicated the set to him. The day he died I had seen the news while at work and a torrent of messages from friends was steadily pouring in all day. I had plans to put up posters for this very show when I was off work but now I was just miserable and so badly wanted to go home and wallow. As I got in my car ready to drive home I saw the posters in my passenger seat. I just wanted to get home fast and see my mom and sister. But looking at the posters sitting there I knew what Lynch would have wanted. So I drove around the city putting up the posters while crying and listening to Lynch soundtracks.

We get to the venue and everything that could go wrong, does go wrong. The power cable for my pedalboard is frayed and stops working. After months of planning and obsessing over every minute detail for this show I somehow overlook something as obvious as my power cable falling apart and was visibly on its way out. It finally chose to kick the bucket at the worst time, but that’s on me. The sound person had never worked this venue and the poor guy is trying to figure everything out. He can only find one single DI. He is frustrated but so incredibly nice to us and has a hilariously bitter sense of humour. There’s an interview filming for TV in the bar section of the venue so we had to stop making noise all together for a solid 45 minutes as the doors time looms closer and closer and nobody has even really started sound-checking yet. Sound guy disappears during this time to hunt down more DI’s. We had sold a decent amount of tickets and the fact that I was playing for complete strangers, in a different city, and nothing is really figured out is all starting to set in. The venue is cool as hell though. There’s blood all over and around the sink in the greenroom. It is a metal venue so I assume it’s prop blood, but it is a VERY metal venue so it could very well be real blood. Something happened with my guitar during the flight and it’s not staying in tune. Doors is in 20 minutes and they are still filming their damn TV thing. We all barely get a soundcheck. But somehow in the nick of time everything comes together as people are walking in, and we play our best show up to that point. All the pent up anxiety of pulling this gig off, and months of planning, was all released on stage and it was truly magical. Utterly surreal and euphoric show. Crowd was incredible. The next morning I woke up early by myself and took a bike ride around the Plateau. Over the course of the next hour and half I had stopped at three different patisseries and got three different croissants. This was perhaps the most content and satisfied with myself I had felt in my entire life up to that point",

Somehow I had two artists onboard that I had admired deeply for some time. Mutable Body had quite an impact on me while I was making “LUANA MOTH”. I felt like such an imposter. I kept asking myself, why would these people want to associate with me? All extremely unhealthy self talk that I am glad to say I do much less of now. I was too nervous to ask the sound person for what I needed, so I just didn’t ask at all. I just wanted the other acts to have plenty of time to setup/soundcheck so I barely soundchecked myself. For my soundcheck I got up on stage, anxiously banged out one or two quick guitar riffs, and called it a day. The result was absolutely catastrophic sound for us when it came time to play. Couldn’t hear what I was doing at all, and it was easily my worst show ever. My monitor wasn’t even on so I spent a lot of time trying to be in front of Giovanna’s monitor, or hovering around my amp. How was the sound person to know any of this if I didn't say anything. I was very disoriented. Bum-notes everywhere. Hitting wrong pedals at wrong times. However, the crowd was our most engaged yet and nobody noticed my clumsy playing, or at least were nice enough to not comment. Lots of dancing and smiles in the room and only very positive feedback afterwards. Giovanna was spectacular as per usual so I suppose that kept the attention off my own little catastrophe taking place on my side of the stage.",
