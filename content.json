      "We are Tony Mazza, and Giovanna Mazza. We are siblings, born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba and we comprise the band “LUANA MOTH”. Despite a twelve year age difference we have always been very close and grow even closer into adulthood now having been bound by Luana and this very project dedicated to her.",
      "Among the common ground between us is our shared affinity for a particular Lake Winnipeg beach town where we had spent and still spend much of our summers. Gimli, Manitoba. A second home, perhaps more home than home."

      "Around 2:00 am one hot summer evening, I (Tony) had left the cabin and taken a walk up to the pier that stretches out into the massive body of water. Nearing the end of the pier I took note of a ratty loose piece of paper on the ground. Naturally curious, I picked up the piece of paper revealing a hastily written poem on one side, and on the reverse simply read the words “LUANA MOTH” in all capitals.",
      "The poem had a very ominous tone and I quickly became obsessed with trying to interpret its meaning. Soon after I would introduce the poem to Giovanna to which it had the same effect. After some sleuthing around town we had discovered that what we thought to be a poem, was actually an incantation of sorts, and what we thought to be the title was the name of its author “LUANA MOTH”. The discovery quickly escalated into an obsession with what we would learn to be an extremely mysterious and enigmatic character, and so began the pursuit to learn everything we could about Luana and even make contact.",
      "Since then we have dedicated this music project to Luana. It encompasses both the unearthing, and ongoing discovery of Luana and the telling of her story through music. We chose to conduct the project under her very namesake “LUANA MOTH” which we believe to be what she demands of us"

      "Little of Luana is known outside of us, and a select group of people whom she shared her pursuits with before disappearing in 2016. Even among these people she withheld the most pertinent information regarding her endeavors. It is known that she was conducting a series of projects, and experiments that were of a paranormal nature. Many of which centered around the urban legend of Pentometra, an entity that is said to reside in Lake Winnipeg. But aside from that we do know she was also working to uncover something that was very real, and very terrestrial. An ongoing development that was as sinister as it was protected. She was either working towards eradicating it by force, or working towards exposing it. Or both. Because of this she worked under different alias’s which ads another layer of complication but exciting depth to our research on Luana.",
      "Due to the nature of her pursuits much of the information pertaining to Luana is highly sensitive and we are very careful about what details are explicitly shared with general public. We apologize for any ambiguity or vague narration. This is to protect Luana. But it has been made clear to us that she wants, or needs her story to be told to some extent.",
      "Luana was last seen summer of 2016. It is believed she was in her mid-twenties at the time. It was this summer that we had found the incantation “halo near the lake bed”. It is widely understood that this evening was the final stage, or perhaps a very important checkpoint in one of her most ambitious undertakings. One that took months, or possibly years of preparation, and involved a very dangerous rendezvous at the bottom of Lake Winnipeg.",
      "There is no unanimous theory about whether she returned or not. Among the many different takes the most prudent of them is that she returned but must conduct herself entirely off-grid, or that she was simply lost to the tumultuous and unpredictable currents of Lake Winnipeg. But others also believe she may have returned in spirit form, as per the legend of Pentometra destines."
